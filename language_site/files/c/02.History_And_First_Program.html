<h3><a id="Software_Engineer__2"></a>Software Engineer :</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A person who has knowledge of programming is a software engineer. sometimes also called as software scientist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software Scientist ----- Software Vendor — Software user — Software end user.</p>
<ol>
<li>Software Scientist (Software creator) : creates software or technology.</li>
<li>Software Vendor: distribute technology on behalf of software creator.</li>
<li>Software User: Uses technology to create bulk products</li>
<li>Software End user: uses technology produt created</li>
</ol>
<p>Will discuss about it in a moment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Technology_12"></a>Technology:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creation of some product or project is technology.<br>
1. Tech Creator created a technology.( Thomas created technology to make bulbs)<br>
2. Vendor distributed that technology… (Let’s say xyz)<br>
3. User used that technology to create in bulk (Philips company workers)<br>
4. End user used that product (We light our homes with bulb)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="History_of_C__19"></a>History of C :</h3>
<pre><code>    -Unix was first Developed by Ken Thompson in posix.
    -The language was not able to fix all issues in linux.
    -Now Ken Thompson needed a language to rewrite linux.
    -Writing a new language will take a lot of time so,
    -He took help of his junior Dennis R. Ritche.
    -Ken Thompson told Dennis what he wanted to do with Language
    -and Dennis wrote all functionalities what Ken wanted.
    -Now Language was written and it was ready to used.
    -Ken Thompson rewrote the entire OS in C.
    -After 2 years he released Unix (Portable and multi-tasking)

    -The Problem was that linux was 16 bit.
    -So, it was slow.
    -We needed some OS that works fast.
    -Richard was 12 years old student who learnt C and was from New Zealand.
    -He told people that OS could work on 32 bit.
    -People did not believe him. He wrote one linux command in 32 bit and proved that it could be written in 32 bit.
    -Richard gathered people who were familiar with C and asked each of them to write one command in 32 bit so, Linux become OS of community and was written in C.

<h3><a id="What_is_16_bit_39"></a>What is 16 bit?</h3>
<pre><code>    - The one cycle of Processor to work is called tic.
    - If any OS completes 16 bit of Work in one cycle then it is called 16 bit.
</code></pre>
<h3><a id="Summary__43"></a>Summary :</h3>
<pre><code>    - Unix was created by Ken Thompson.
    - Dennis Ritche created C language.
    - Unix was 16 bit
    - Linux was 32 bit written by community and started by Richard.

<h3><a id="Lets_Discuss_about_C_49"></a>Let’s Discuss about C</h3>
<pre><code>    -Inclusion of 'stdio.h' in not necessary.
    -Follow ANSI Standard.

<h3><a id="Requirements_to_run_C_program_on_machine_53"></a>Requirements to run C program on machine.</h3>
<pre><code>    1. Text Editor
    2. Compiler
    3. API (Application Programming Interface)
    4. Debugger
    5. Manual

<h3><a id="Who_will_provide_me_all_these_things_60"></a>Who will provide me all these things?</h3>
<pre><code>    -Tech Creator or Tech Vendor.
</code></pre>
<h3><a id="Software_could_be_categorised_in_two_parts__63"></a>Software could be categorised in two parts :</h3>
<pre><code>    - Software Projects
    - Software Products
</code></pre>
<h3><a id="Software_Projects_67"></a>Software Projects:</h3>
<pre><code>Software Projects are made for specific purpose and are available to specific person even after completion of software by developer.
Example - Metro Ticketing System. 
            It could be only by metro employees. You can take tickets but cannot use software to issue tickets.
</code></pre>
<h3><a id="Software_Products_71"></a>Software Products:</h3>
<pre><code>Software Products are softwares that are made for general purpose and are available to a wide range of persons.
Example- Microsoft Word, Paint, Tally, VLC, AllPlayer, etc...
            These softwares could be used by anyone for their own purposes.

Before Completion                       After Completion        Called As
-Project                                -Project                -Project
-Project                                -Product                -Product

<h3><a id="C_Program_80"></a>C Program</h3>
<pre><code>Let's Write our first program.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-c">        <span class="hljs-preprocessor">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span><span class="hljs-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

        <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
            <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World\n"</span>);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        }
</code></pre>
<h3><a id="C_Program_Explanation_90"></a>C Program Explanation:</h3>
<pre><code>Header files Contain pre built functions for us.
    - These are included using a reserved keyword #include&lt;Filename.h&gt;
If we create a header file other than system.
    -Use syntax : #include &quot;filename.h&quot;

main is entry point of our C program. Every program should have a main function.
    -In our case main returns an integer value.
    - return is a reserved keyword in C to return a value back from function.

printf is a function used to print some output to screen.

Statement Terminator ';' or semicolon is used to terminate c Statement.
